== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-organization/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**WPSSO Core add-on to manage Organizations and additional Schema markup properties (Organizer, Performer, Publisher, etc.) for Google Rich Cards / Knowledge Graph.**

Customize your WebSite name, alternate name, description, and URL for each WordPress local / language / region.

Select an Organization sub-type (Corporation, Educational, NGO, Performing Group, etc.), logo and/or banner for Schema Articles.

Add Local SEO Place / Location information to your Schema Organization markup.

Select a different Publisher for your Schema Article markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

Select an Organizer or Performer for the Schema Event markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

Select a Hiring Organization for the Schema Job Posting markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

WPSSO Organization Markup is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance &mdash; WPSSO Core and its add-ons make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light. WPSSO Core and its add-ons are also fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).

<h3>WPSSO Core Plugin Prerequisite</h3>

WPSSO Organization Markup (aka WPSSO ORG) is an add-on for the WPSSO Core plugin &mdash; which creates complete &amp; accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your existing content for social sharing, Social Media Optimization (SMO), Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Rich Cards, Pinterest Rich Pins, etc.

The Free add-on plugin works with either the Free or Pro version of WPSSO Core. The [WPSSO ORG Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-organization/?utm_source=wpssoorg-readme-prereq) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features and requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssoorg-readme-prereq).
