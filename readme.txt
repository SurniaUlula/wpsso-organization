<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-organization/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Manage Organization markup for Google's Rich Cards and Knowledge Graph.**

Customize your Website name, alternate name, description, and URL for each WordPress local / language / region.

Select an Organization sub-type (Corporation, Educational, NGO, Performing Group, etc.), logo and/or banner for Schema Articles.

Add Local SEO Place / Location information to your Schema Organization markup.

Select a different Publisher for your Schema Article markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

Select an Organizer or Performer for the Schema Event markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

**WPSSO ORG is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its extensions make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light.

WPSSO Core and its extensions are fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.3 or better required).

<h3>WPSSO Core Plugin Prerequisite</h3>

WPSSO Organization Markup is an extension for the WPSSO Core plugin &mdash; which creates complete &amp; accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your content for social sharing, social media / SMO, search / SEO / rich cards, and more.

The WPSSO ORG Free extension works with either the Free or Pro version of WPSSO Core (Main Plugin).

The [WPSSO ORG Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-organization/?utm_source=wpssoorg-readme-prereq) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features, which requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssoorg-readme-prereq).
